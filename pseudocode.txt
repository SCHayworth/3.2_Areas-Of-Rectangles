The area of a rectangle is the rectangle's length times its width. Write a program that asks for the length and width of TWO rectangles. The program should tell the user which rectangle has the greatest area, or if the areas are the same.

1.	Prompt user for length of rectangle A and store it in a variable
2.	Prompt user for width of rectangle A and store it in a variable
3.	Multiply length of A by with of A and store the result in a variable
4.	Prompt user for length of rectangle B and store it in a variable
5.	Prompt user for width of rectangle B and store it in a variable
6.	Multiply length of B by with of B and store the result in a variable
7.	If area of A is greater than area of B, display "Rectangle A has the greatest area!"
8.	If area of A is less than area of B, display "Rectangle B has the greatest area!"
9.	If area of A is equal to area of B, display "The areas of rectangles A and B are the same!"
